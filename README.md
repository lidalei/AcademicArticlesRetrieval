* User feedback Rocchio algorithm

* Co-Author

And for other functions mentioned in report, you may refer to corresponding folders.

# How to Run
To run the project properly, you should have 64 bit Python 2.7.10 installed. Moreover, it relies on the following packages:

* sk-learn
* nltk (including corpus)
* Scipy (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/xmshzit7/scipy-0.16.1-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl)
* Matplotlib (which depends on numpy)
* ipython
* pandas
* sympy
* nose
* flask

After you doing those things successfully (it's very easy if you use pip), just run 'python index.py' on command promot or shell and you will be able to explore these functions through browser. The website IP is 127.0.0.1:5000.

Thanks!
